    Longmont's Weld County portion consumed 31,000,000 kWh in 2021.</p> <p>4) T&D
    losses are calculated for Xcel and Longmont based on the EIA 861 (https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/)
    reported data. Specifically the Utility Operational Data_2021. Spreadsheet on
    file.</p> <p>5) Propane data provided by Matt Hanson with FerrellGas. Spreadsheet
    on file.</p> <p>6) Houses heated with wood were pulled from the US Census Bureau,
    data on file. It was assumed that all of the houses heated by wood in Longmont
    fell within the Boulder County portion of Longmont.</p> <p>7) Longmont Power and
    Communications data was provided in an email by Chuck Finleon with Longmont Power
    & Communications. PDF on file.</p> <p>8) Longmont Power & Communications and Lyons
    Municipal rooftop solar data was provided in kW of capacity rather than kWh generated.
    NREL's PVWatts wasused to estimate kWh generated by rooftop solar systems. PDF
    of results on file. See https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/</p> <p>10) Due to Xcel's 15/15
    rule, with less than 15 customers in the commercial and residential data sets
    they cannot provide usage for those customers to avoid violating privacy concerns.
    Therefore Lotus applied the average residential and commercial kWh use from LPC
    to the 7 residential and commercial customers (respectively) in Xcel territory
    to estimate use.</p> <p>11) PRPA emission factor and transmission and distribution
    loss rate for 2021 was provided by Francie Jaffe. Email on file. Emissions factor

  lead_title_en: Development version
  lead_paragraph_en: <p>This is a test version of the City of Longmont's interactive
    scenario modeling platform for the Net Zero goal. All information on this website
    is to be considered incomplete and experimental.</p> <p>The goal of this tool
    is to provide a transparent and defensible calculation methodology for estimating
    the potential of GHG emission reduction strategies and interactive data visualizations
    to represent the emission reduction potential of those strategies.</p> <p><b>Background</b></p>
    <p>This spreadsheet compiles strategy information and associated assumptions and
    data to estimate GHG emission reductions from key building energy, electric grid,
    renewable energy, mobile, solid waste, and oil and gas strategies. Previous versions
    of this model based emission reductions  on Longmont's "core" emissions, which
    include emissions from electricity, natural gas, gasoline, solid waste, and oil
    wells. These emission sources are the main focus of the GHG reduction strategies
    and make up approximately 83% of Longmont's total emissions in 2016 as reported
    in the Final_City of Longmont 2016 GHG Inventory Workbook. This updated version
    of the model bases emissions reductions on Longmont's total emissions. This update
    also added emission values from Longmont's 2019 emissions inventory as reported
    in the FINAL_Longmont_2019_Inventory_060220 workbook.</p>

- id: updating
  name: Updating Guide
  path: /updating
  lead_paragraph_en: <p>This page provides instructions on how to update this tool
    and which values can be updated. A general set of directions is provided, followed
    by a table documenting which values on each tab can be updated and when it is
    appropriate to do so.</p> <p><b>Updating the Model</b></p> <p>The purpose of this
    model is to demonstrate the GHG reduction potential of Longmont´s strategies compared
    to Business-As-Usual emissions (if no strategies were implemented) based on a
    2016 or 2018 baseline. Updates to this model should be decided based on the below
    criteria.</p> <p>The model should NOT be updated for the following reasons.</p>
    <li> <ul>Future GHG emissions inventories. The BAU tab should not be updated with
    actual GHG emissions values in future years. The purpose of the BAU is to show
    emissions if no strategies were to be implemented. Using actual GHG values in
    future years when several strategies have been implemented would misrepresent
    BAU emissions and may double count savings. Actual emissions from future GHG inventories
    can be entered into the Progress Tracker tab so Longmont can monitor if actual
    GHG emissions align with expected reductions due to strategy implementation.</ul>
    <ul>LPC electricity emission factor updates. Future emission factors from LPC
    should not be added to this tool as the emission factors will reflect the renewable
    energy strategy modeled in this tool. The BAU LPC emission factor represents the
    emission factor if LPC were to not pursue renewable energy. The renewable energy
    EF is used directly in the modeled strategies and should not be adjusted with
    actual values to preserve the desired progress toward RE modeled in this tool.
    Actual progress towards the renewable energy goal will be tracked in each of Longmont's
    future GHG inventories. Inventory results can be compared to the modeled values
    in the Progress Tracker tab.</ul> <ul>Minor changes in emission calculation methodology.
    Baseline year emissions in the BAU should not be updated when minor methodology
    changes in calculation occur. If methodology changes would not impact total emissions
    in the baseline by greater than 5% then emissions should not be updated for the
    baseline year.</ul></li> The model should be updated for the following reasons
    <li> <ul>Changes to strategy targets or assumptions. If the target for a strategy
    is updated, the target should be updated in the Model Inputs tab and any calculation
    adjustments be made in the corresponding model tab. If more accurate and defensible
    assumptions can be made for a strategy compared to current assumption, assumptions
    should be updated in the Model Inputs tab.</ul> <ul>Xcel electricity emission
    factor updates. Xcel provides a small portion of electricity to Longmont and is
    not a part of LPC's goal for 100% renewable energy which is modeled in this tool.
    As such, Xcel's emission factors should be updated either each year or whenever
    new GHG inventory data is available for input in the Progress Tracker tab. This
    ensures that factors outside of the modeled strategies control are as accurate
    as possible.</ul> <ul>Updates to model parameter data (e.g., population and registered
    vehicles). Model parameter data includes model inputs that are NOT impacted by
    strategies. This includes population and registered vehicle data. As no strategies
    currently modeled have an impact on these parameters, they should be updated when
    possible to ensure modeling is using the most up to date external information
    for calculating emissions and emissions reductions. For example, if population
    were to increase more than is currently forecasted in a future year and this number
    were to not be updated, then emissions in the BAU would be nderestimated as the
    BAU uses population increase as a major parameter for forecasting.</ul> <ul>Major
    changes to emission calculation methodology. Major changes to emission calculation
    methodology may warrant updates to the baseline years. Changes that would drastically
    impact emission numbers and make accurate comparison to previous year's inventory
    data inaccurate would require updating the baseline years to ensure alignment
    across years. For example, the 2016 baseline year emissions were updated as new
    Global Warming Potential values were released by the IPCC. If emissions in future
    years in the BAU or in modeled strategies were calculated with the updated GWPs
    while the baseline year used old GWPs, emissions calculations would not have an
    accurate baseline comparison. Major changes like GWP updates will likely be infrequent.</ul>

    targets.</ul> <ul><b>Target year.</b> Update to reflect any changes in strategy
    target years.</ul> <ul><b>Business As Usual Baseline emissions.</b> Baseline emissions
    (2016 or 2018) should only be updated if there are major changes to emission calculation
    methodology in future years that would detrimentally impact the models ability
    to compare future emissions to the baseline. Actual GHG emission data for future
    years should NOT be entered into this tab.</ul> <ul><b>Non-electricity emission
    factors.</b> Non-electricity emission factors likely will not change often. It
    is recommended to review emission factor values for updates every few years.</ul>
    <ul><b>Population.</b> Update population data as actual data becomes available.</ul>
    <ul><b>Xcel Energy electricity emission factor.</b> Updated Xcel's emission factor
    as actual data becomes available.</ul> <ul><b>LPC RE and BAU emission factors.</b>
    Do not update.</ul> <ul><b>Fuel efficiencies.</b> Only update the "Gasoline Passenger
    Vehicle Projected fuel efficiency" row if new fuel efficiency standards are released.</ul>
    <ul><b>Registered vehicles.</b> Update registered vehicle data as actual data
    becomes available.</ul> </li>
